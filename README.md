## Install & run using Docker

(These instructions are for Linux. On OSX/Windows, Docker has to be installed
differently.)

* Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation) and [Fig](http://www.fig.sh/).
* Then run: `sudo fig up`

The website is now available at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). Posts and stylesheets will automatically be recompiled on change.

## Non-Docker Install

This site is build using jekyll.

    sudo gem install jekyll
    sudo gem install rdiscount
    sudo gem install bundler

Install dependencies:

    bundle install

### Change Stylesheets

The stylesheets are written in SASS/SCSS and are found in folder `_sass`. After changing the code you must compile manually to CSS with:

    compass compile

Or run `compass watch` to automatically recompile after saving a file. If you intend to run the webserver as well, you don't need to compile the SASS code by hand. It is then managed by `bundler`/`jekyll`.


### Run

    bundle exec jekyll serve

The website is now available at http://localhost:3000
